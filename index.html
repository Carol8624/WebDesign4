		<header>An Age Yet to Come</header>
		<blockquote>The Wheel of Time turns, and Ages come and pass, 
		leaving memories that become legend.
		Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten
		when the Age that gave it birth comes again.
		In one Age, called the Third Age by some, an Age yet to
		come, an Age long past, a wind rose above the great mountainous 
		island of Tremalking.
		The wind was not the beginning. There are neither beginnings
		nor endings to the Wheel of Time. But it was a beginning.
		 </blockquote>

		
			
			
			
		<h2 class= "text-gradient">The Wheel of Time Series</h2>
		
		<p>One of the greatest fantasy sagas of our time began in 1984 when the writer James Oliver Rigney asked himself, 
		"What would it be like to be tapped on the shoulder and told you were going to save the world, but also destroy it?" 
 Thus began his journey of writing what would become, The Wheel of Time, written under the pen name Robert Jordan.
 The first book in the series, The Eye of the World was published in 1990 by Tor Books and has been in continuous print
 ever since. It is published in the United Kingdom by Orbit Books. 
Each book of the series has appeared on the New York Times best-seller list, 
and each one since the eighth (The Path of Daggers) debuted at #1.</p><br>

		<p>The Wheel of Time is a series of high fantasy novels by American author Robert Jordan,
		with Brandon Sanderson as a co-author for the final three installments. Originally planned 
		as a six-book series with the publication of The Eye of the World in 1990, by Tor Books and has been in 
		continuous print ever since. It is published in the United Kingdom by Orbit Books.</p>
		<p>The Wheel of Time came to span 14 volumes, in addition to a prequel novel and three companion books. Jordan died 
		in 2007 while working on what was planned to be the twelfth and final volume in the series. 
		He prepared extensive notes, which enabled fellow fantasy author Sanderson to complete the 
		final book, which grew into three volumes: The Gathering Storm (2009), Towers of Midnight (2010)
		, and A Memory of Light (2013).</p><br>
		
<p>The series draws on numerous elements of both European and Asian mythology, most notably the cyclical
 nature of time found in Buddhism and Hinduism; the metaphysical concepts of balance, duality, and a
 respect for nature found in Taoism; and the dualistic concepts of God and Satan.</p>
<p>The Wheel of Time is notable for its length, detailed imaginary world, magic system, and its large cast
 of characters. The eighth through fourteenth books each reached number one on the New York Times Best Seller list.
 After its completion, the series was nominated for a Hugo Award. As of 2021, the series has sold over 90 million
 copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling epic fantasy series since The Lord of the Rings. Its popularity
 has spawned comic book adaptations, a collectible card game, a video game, a roleplaying game, and a soundtrack album.
 A television series adaptation produced by Sony Pictures and Amazon Studios premiered in 2021.</p><br>
 
<h3 class ="text-gradient"> Backstory</h3>
<p>In the backstory of the series, the Wheel of Time and the universe were forged at the dawn of time by a deity known as the
 Creator, simultaneously imprisoning its antithesis, the Dark One. The One Power itself is divided into both male (saidin) 
 and female (saidar) halves, and originally both genders could wield it. In the Age of Legends, the Aes Sedai was made up 
 of both men and women who could channel. An Aes Sedai experiment inadvertently drilled what would become known as the Bore 
 into the Dark One's prison, and his influence began to seep out into the world. In response to the threat of his eventual 
 release, the Wheel produced the Dragon, Lews Therin Telamon, a channeler of immense power.Lews eventually rose to command 
 the Aes Sedai and their allies in the struggle against the Dark One's forces.</p><br>
 <p>Seven Seals were created, made of an unbreakable 
 substance called cuendillar, to be used as focus points to reseal the Dark One's prison for good. Lews and a host of 99 male
 channelers managed to imprison the Forsaken with their master, but at the moment of victory, the Dark One was able to taint 
 saidin, driving male channelers insane. Lews killed his friends and family, and then himself. Other male channelers devastated 
 the world with earthquakes and tidal waves, an event called the Breaking of the World, before destroying themselves.</p><br>
 <p>The female Aes Sedai guided humanity out of this dark time, living in the shadow of a prophecy that the Dark One would break
 free from his prison and the Dragon would be reborn to fight him once more. And though the Dragon Reborn is humanity's only
 hope against the Dark One, he would break the world a second time in the process.</p><br>
 
 

<h4 class ="text-gradient">Plot</h4>
<p>Further information: List of The Wheel of Time characters</p>
<p>In The Eye of the World (1990), the arrival of a mysterious noblewoman to the remote village of Emond's Field in the Two Rivers
 precedes an attack on the town by a force of humanoid monsters called Trollocs. The woman reveals herself to be Moiraine Damodred,
 one of the Aes Sedai, and warns that the servants of the Dark One are seeking one of three young men from the village: Rand al'Thor,
 Perrin Aybara and Matrim Cauthon. They leave with Moiraine and her companion, the Warder Lan Mandragoran, and are joined by Egwene
 al'Vere, in whom Moiraine sees a potential Aes Sedai; the gleeman Thom Merrilin; and later the Wisdom Nynaeve al'Meara, a healer
 who learns she can also channel the One Power. They are pursued by increasing numbers of Trollocs, led by deadly, eyeless Fades,
 and are separated fleeing the cursed, abandoned city of Shadar Logoth. At the Eye of the World, a sacred pool of untainted saidin,
 Rand's defeat of the Forsaken Aginor and Ba'alzamon convinces Moiraine that he is the prophesied Dragon Reborn.</p><br>
<p>From then, the story expands and protagonist Rand, as well as the other characters, are frequently split into different groups,
 pursuing different missions or agendas aimed at furthering the cause of the Dragon Reborn, sometimes thousands of miles apart.
 Broadly speaking, the original group of characters from the Two Rivers make new allies, gain experience, and become figures of 
 some influence and authority. As they struggle to unite the western kingdoms against the Dark One's forces, their task is complicated 
 by rulers of the nations who refuse to give up their authority and by factions such as the Children of the Light, who do not believe
 in the prophecies, and the Seanchan, the people of a long-lost colony of Artur Hawkwing's empire across the western ocean who have 
 returned, believing it is their destiny to conquer the world. The Aes Sedai also become divided between those who believe the 
 Dragon Reborn should be strictly controlled and those who believe he must lead them into battle as he did in the earlier war. 
 As the story expands, new characters representing different factions are introduced; although this expansion of the narrative 
 allows the sheer scale of the growing struggle to be effectively depicted, it has been criticized for slowing the pace of the novels 
 and sometimes reducing the appearances of the original or main cast to extended cameos.</p><br>
<p>By the sixth novel, Lord of Chaos (1994), it has become clear that the Last Battle, triggered when the Dark One is able to exert 
its influence directly on the world once more, is imminent, as only three Seals (keys to the Dark One's prison) are intact. 
Once the remaining Seals break, the Dark One will be free to touch the world. The Last Battle, Tarmon Gai'don, is depicted in the
 fourteenth and final novel in the series, A Memory of Light (2013).</p><br>

 
 
 

 
 <h3 class="text-gradient">Setting</h3>
<h5 class="text-gradient">The One Power and the Aes Sedai</h5>
<p>The series is set in the Third Age of a fantasy world in which the pattern of human existence 
is determined and maintained by the Wheel of Time, a cosmic embodiment of eternal return.
 The Wheel spins the Pattern of the Ages, manifest in both the physical world and human destiny,
 using the lives of men and women as its threads, and individuals with the power to influence and 
 change the Pattern are called ta'veren. The Wheel is rotated by a magical force called the One Power.
 The ability to access and wield the One Power is known as channeling, and only women can do this safely.
 Artifacts called angreal amplify the One Power, with sa'angreal being the most potent, and ter'angreal limited 
 to specific functions.</p><br>
<p>A matriarchal order called the Aes Sedai, made up of female channelers, are both respected and feared across
 the world. Their stated goal is to use their skills to serve and protect humanity, but they are also preparing 
 for the inevitable, prophesized return of a malevolent entity they call the Dark One. The leader of the Aes Sedai,
 known as the Amyrlin Seat, rules from the White Tower in the city of Tar Valon. The order is divided into seven disciplines,
 or Ajahs: the Blue Ajah are dedicated to the pursuit of justice and inevitably intrigue, possessing extensive spy networks; 
 the Brown Ajah are dedicated to the preservation of knowledge and history; the Gray Ajah are dedicated to mediation and politics;
 the Green Ajah are warriors trained in battle and strategy; the Red Ajah monitor the use of the One Power by outsiders; 
 the White Ajah are concerned with logic and truth; the Yellow Ajah are mistresses of healing; and a secret eighth faction, 
 the Black Ajah, pose as members of other Ajahs but serve the Dark One. The few men born with the ability to channel ultimately 
 go mad, so the Red Ajah hunt male channelers and "gentle" them, or cut them off permanently from the One Power, ever aware of the 
 danger they represent. With the exception of the Red Ajah, the Aes Sedai each bond magically with a Warder, a male protector. 
 The link bestows the Warder with heightened senses, strength, stamina and resistance to injury.
</p><br>

					<h6 class ="text-gradient">Geography and cultures</h6>

<p> 
The primary continent depicted in the series consists of three regions: the Westlands, Shara far to the east, and the Aiel Waste
 in between. Connecting these three areas in the north is the eastern part of the Great Blight, a once-verdant land mass that has
 been corrupted by the Dark One's influence. It stretches far west across the Aryth Ocean and borders the north of the continent of 
 Seanchan. South of the Westlands is the Sea of Storms, and the small continent known as the Land of the Madmen. The Westlands contain
 14 nations, including Andor, Cairhien, Illian, Shienar and Tear,as well as four major city-states: Falme, Far Madding, Mayene
 and Tar Valon. Other notable cities include Caemlyn, the capital of Andor, and Fal Dara, the northernmost city in Shienar.
 Two Rivers is a region in Andor which includes the village Emond's Field, home of five of the series' main characters. Shara, which
 extends much further south than either the Westlands or the Aiel Waste, is separated from the rest of the continent by the Cliffs of the
 Dawn and the Great Rift. Shara remains mysterious to outsiders, who are only allowed to enter walled-off towns to trade. The world in which 
 the series is set is sometimes called "Randland" by fans, referring to lead character Rand al'Thor.</p><br>
<p>The Seanchan are a vast and powerful empire whose civilization has developed at a distance from the primary continent of the series. 
Their culture enslaves female channelers, who they believe are too dangerous to be free. Such channelers, known as damane, are collared with 
a ter'angreal called an a'dam, which allows women known as sul'dam to harness and control their channeling power. As the Seanchan invade, they
 use the a'dam to enslave any Aes Sedai they can. Also opposing the Aes Sedai are the Children of the Light, or Whitecloaks, 
 a quasi-religious, militarized order bent on destroying anyone who channels the One Power, believing they are servants of the Shadow.In Shara,
 channelers are known as Ayyad, and isolate themselves in special communities. The females, who secretly control the monarchy, cultivate a 
 bloodline of channelers by using male Ayyad as uneducated breeding stock and executing them by age 21.</p><br>
<p>The Aiel are a fierce warrior race who live in the Three-fold Land, called the Aiel Waste by outsiders, an inhospitable desert region
 located between the Westlands and Shara. They are tall, with characteristic pale eyes, and red or blond hair. There are 12 Aiel clans,
 plus the extinct Jenn Aiel, who built the city of Rhuidean, a repository of Aiel history and culture. The Maidens of the Spear are an
 all-female warrior society among the Aiel. Female Aiel who can channel the One Power or navigate Tel'aran'rhiod, the World of Dreams, 
 do not join the Aes Sedai, instead becoming known as Wise Ones. The Aiel await a prophesied "Chief of Chiefs", whom they call the 
 Car'a'carn, who will unite and rule all the clans</p><br>
<p>The Ogier are a hirsute, wide-featured and immensely tall and strong species of humanoid known for their proficiency in woodwork and masonry.
 Though physically intimidating, they are peaceful, intelligent and interested in historical and genealogical study. The Ogier also possess a 
 unique ability called treesinging, whereby they stimulate the growth and healing of trees and plants by singing to them. They live in sanctuaries 
 called steddings, in which the One Power is inaccessible. After the Breaking of the World, male channelers who sought sanctuary with the Ogier 
 thanked them by creating the Ways, a series of paths through an alternate dimension that connected Ogier communities. Stone doorways called 
 Waygates, placed outside each stedding, were used to travel long distances quickly. In the millennia that followed, however, the Ways were 
 corrupted by a malevolent force known as the Machin Shin, or Black Wind, which attacks travelers.</p><br>
<p>The Tinkers, or Tuatha'an, are a nomadic group of people who travel continuously and widely in brightly colored wagons, believing this is 
the only way to remain safe. They follow the pacifistic Way of the Leaf, which eschews violence. The Tuatha'an's main purpose has evolved 
to searching for "The Song", lost during the Breaking of the World, which they claim they will know when they find it.</p><br>
<p> The Sea Folk,or Atha'an Miere, are dark-skinned people with complex customs who live on ships and on islands in the Sea of Storms. They only appear 
 on the mainland to trade goods, and Sea Folk porcelain sculptures, delicate and graceful objects of art, are highly prized by mainlanders.
 Unknown to any but the Atha'an Miere, the fabled porcelain is created by the Amayar, a group of island dwelling people protected by the 
 Sea Folk as a solemn duty since the Breaking of the World. The Amayar adhere to the Water Way, a pacifistic way of life akin to the Way 
 of the Leaf practiced by the Tuatha'an.</p><br>

<h6 class ="text-gradient">About the Author</h6>
<img src = "images/robert-jordan.jpg" alt = "robert jordan" 
					width = "200" height = "200">
<p>Robert Jordan was the pen name of James Oliver Rigney, Jr., under which he was best known as the author of the bestselling
 The Wheel of Time fantasy series. He also wrote under the names Reagan O'Neal and Jackson O'Reilly.
Jordan was born in Charleston, South Carolina. He served two tours in Vietnam (from 1968 to 1970) with the United States 
Army as a helicopter gunner. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross with bronze oak leaf cluster, the Bronze Star 
with "V" and bronze oak leaf cluster, and two Vietnamese Gallantry Crosses with palm. After returning from Vietnam he 
attended The Citadel where he received an undergraduate degree in physics. After graduating he was employed by the United
 States Navy as a nuclear engineer. He began writing in 1977. He was a history buff and enjoyed hunting, fishing, sailing,
 poker, chess, pool, and pipe collecting.
 
He described himself as a "High Church" Episcopalian and received communion more than once a week. He lived with his wife 
Harriet McDougal, who works as a book editor (currently with Tor Books; she was also Jordan's editor) in a house built in 1797.</p><br>

<p>Responding to queries on the similarity of some of the concepts in his Wheel of Time books with Freemasonry concepts, Jordan 
admitted that he was a Freemason. However, "like his father and grandfather," he preferred not to advertise, possibly because
 of the negative propaganda against Freemasonry. In his own words, "no man in this country should feel in danger because of his beliefs."</p><br>

<p>On March 23, 2006, Jordan disclosed in a statement that he had been diagnosed with cardiac amyloidosis, and that with treatment,
 his median life expectancy was four years, though he said he intended to beat the statistics. He later posted on his Dragonmount
 blog to encourage his fans not to worry about him and that he intended to have a long and fully creative life.
He began chemotherapy treatment at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, in early April 2006. Jordan was enrolled in a study using 
the drug Revlimid just approved for multiple myeloma but not yet tested on primary amyloidosis.</p><br>

<p>Jordan died at approximately 2:45 p.m. EDT on September 16, 2007, and a funeral service was held for him on Wednesday, September 19,
 2007. Jordan was cremated and his ashes buried in the churchyard of St. James Church in Goose Creek, outside Charleston.</p><br>
 
 <p>Robert Jordan passed away from this rare blood disease, in 2007, before The Wheel of Time series was complete.
He asked his wife Harriet McDougal to find someone to finish the series and after he passed away, she went hunting.
 She considered it something of a dying request so she searched through a lot of fantasy authors.
As a result, the final 3 books in the series, (Books 12-14) were completed by fantasy author Brandon Sanderson.</p><br>
<p> Jordan left behind an abundance of notes and audio recordings, which allowed his family and Brandon to tie up the series in a way that
 very closely matches his original vision.
 A quote from, Brandon Sanderson: <q>Oh, man, it’s hard to explain what it was like because I started reading these books as a kid. 
I studied The Wheel of Time when I was trying to figure out how to write fantasy books in my twenties. So to be handed this project and be 
able to help finish the work of one of my heroes felt really good, but the weight of it was also like an enormous burden. I really wanted 
to make sure that I did a good job. Beyond that, there are millions of fans who all love the series so much and I felt a great debt to them.
 With my books, I own them so I going to tell my vision and I’m less worried about what the fan reaction will be. But with The Wheel Of Time books,
 I feel that they own them as much if not more than I do. I’m a steward of these books rather than the owner, so I had to keep that in mind and 
 take a different approach.</q></p><br>
